My name is Anders, or Albot, I can't seem to remember which. Anyways, this is my GitHub profile!  

Here you can expect to find predominantly school related repos since I'm currently enrolled in Ivy League studies at IT-Högskolan.
The one to teach us about the dark arts of AI is none other than [Raphael](https://github.com/pr0fez).
